* Define Bag ADT
A bag is a container that stores a collection in which duplicate values are
allowed. The items, each of which is individually stored, have no particular
order but they must be comparable.
- Bag(): Creates a bag that is initially empty.
- length (): Returns the number of items stored in the bag. Accessed using
  the len() function.
- contains ( item ): Determines if the given target item is stored in the
  bag and returns the appropriate boolean value. Accessed using the in
  operator.
- add( item ): Adds the given item to the bag.
- remove( item ): Removes and returns an occurrence of item from the bag.
  An exception is raised if the element is not in the bag.
- iterator (): Creates and returns an iterator that can be used to iterate over
the collection of items.
