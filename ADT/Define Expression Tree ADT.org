* Define Expression Tree ADT
An expression tree is a binary tree representation of an arithmetic expression
that consists of various operators (+, -, *, /, %) and operands comprised of
single integer digits and single-letter variables within a fully parenthesized
expression.

- ExpressionTree( expStr ): Builds an expression tree for the expression given
  in expStr. Assume the string contains a valid, fully parenthesized expression.
- evaluate( varDict ): Evaluates the expression tree and returns the numeric
  result. The values of the single-letter variables are extracted from the
  supplied dictionary structure. An exception is raised if there is a division
  by zero error or an undefined variable is used.
- toString (): Constructs and returns a string representation of the expression.
