* Define Stack ADT
A stack is a data structure that stores a linear collection of items with access
limited to a last-in first-out order. Adding and removing items is restricted to
one end known as the top of the stack. An empty stack is one containing no
items.

- Stack(): Creates a new empty stack.
- isEmpty(): Returns a boolean value indicating if the stack is empty.
- length (): Returns the number of items in the stack.
- pop(): Removes and returns the top item of the stack, if the stack is not
  empty. Items cannot be popped from an empty stack. The next item on the stack
  be comes the new top item.
- peek(): Returns a reference to the item on top of a non-empty stack without
  removing it. Peeking, which cannot be done on an empty stack, does not modify
  the stack contents.
- push( item ): Adds the given item to the top of the stack.
