* Define Queue ADT
  A queue is a data structure that a linear collection of items in which access
  is restricted to a first-in first-out basis. New items are inserted at the
  back and existing items are removed from the front. The items are maintained
  in the order in which they are added to the structure.

  - Queue(): Creates a new empty queue, which is a queue containing no items.
  - isEmpty(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether the queue is empty.
  - length (): Returns the number of items currently in the queue.
  - enqueue( item ): Adds the given item to the back of the queue.
  - dequeue(): Removes and returns the front item from the queue. An item can-
    not be dequeued from an empty queue.
