* Define Set ADT
A set is a container that stores a collection of unique values over a given
comparable domain in which the stored values have no particular ordering.
- Set(): Creates a new set initialized to the empty set.
- length (): Returns the number of elements in the set, also known as the
  cardinality. Accessed using the len() function.
- contains ( element ): Determines if the given value is an element of the set
  and returns the appropriate boolean value. Accessed using the in operator.
- add( element ): Modifies the set by adding the given value or element to the
  set if the element is not already a member. If the element is not unique, no
  action is taken and the operation is skipped.
- remove( element ): Removes the given value from the set if the value is con-
  tained in the set and raises an exception otherwise.
- equals ( setB ): Determines if the set is equal to another set and returns a
  boolean value. For two sets, A and B, to be equal, both A and B must contain
  the same number of elements and all elements in A must also be elements in B.
  If both sets are empty, the sets are equal. Access with == or != .
- isSubsetOf( setB ): Determines if the set is a subset of another set and re-
  turns a boolean value. For set A to be a subset of B, all elements in A must
  also be elements in B.
- union( setB ): Creates and returns a new set that is the union of this set and
  setB. The new set created from the union of two sets, A and B, contains all
  elements in A plus those elements in B that are not in A. Neither set A nor
  set B is modified by this operation.
- intersect( setB ): Creates and returns a new set that is the intersection of
  this set and setB. The intersection of sets A and B contains only those
  elements that are in both A and B. Neither set A nor set B is modified by this
  operation.
- difference( setB ): Creates and returns a new set that is the difference of
  this set and setB. The set difference, A âˆ’ B, contains only those elements
  that are in A but not in B. Neither set A nor set B is modified by this
  operation.
- iterator (): Creates and returns an iterator that can be used to iterate over
  the collection of items.
