* 9.1 The Doubly Linked List
** 9.1.1 Organization
   doubly linked list, each node contains not only the data component and a
   link to the next node as in the singly linked list, but also a second link
   that points to the preceding node.

* 9.2 The Circular Linked List
** ^
   circular linked list in which the nodes form a continuous circle.
** 9.2.1 Organization
   next field of the last node links to the first, and in the doubly linked
   version, the prev field of the first node links to the last.

* 9.3 Multi-Linked Lists
** ^
   multi-linked list is one in which each node contains multiple link fields
   which are used to create multiple chains within the same collection of
   nodes.
